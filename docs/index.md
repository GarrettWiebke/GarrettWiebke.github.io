## Introduction

* This report website focuses on the design of the Water Pump Subsystem in the Automatic Plant Care system 

### Project Summary

* The Water Pump Subsystem is one of 4 subsystems included in Team 106's Automatic Plant Care System [Team Website](https://asu-egr304-2025-f-106.github.io/ASU-EGR304-2025-F-106/) and is designed to water the plant's soil using data from JT's Moisture Sensor Subsystem. Having fully autonomous watering of the plant alleviates the consistent work of having to care for the plant everyday and ideally saves water by preventing overwatering. 


### My Contribution

To review the details used to show how the subsystems components connect to the microcontroller and other subsystems , you can review it in the ["Block Diagram"](https://garrettwiebke.github.io/01-Block-Diagram/Block-Diagram//) section of the datasheet.

To review the details on how components were selected for this subsystem, you can review it in the ["Component Selection"](https://garrettwiebke.github.io/02-Component-Selection/Component-Selection/) section of the datasheet.

To review the details listed of the material used to construct the subsection, you can review it in the ["BOM"](https://garrettwiebke.github.io/03-BOM/BOM/) section of the datasheet.

To review the details of the electrical schematic, you can review it in the ["Schematic"](https://garrettwiebke.github.io/04-Schematic/schematic/) section of the datasheet.

To review the details listed of how the subsystem will be powered and its power draw, you can review it in the ["Power Budget"](https://garrettwiebke.github.io/05-Power-Budget/Power-Budget/) section of the datasheet.
