## Overview
This block diagram represents the water pump subsystem of Team 106's Automatic Plant Care System.

* 9V Unregulated wall outlet power supply
* 5V coming from linear voltage regulator.
* 5V through hole water pump from adafruit.
* Recieveing data from JT's moisture sensor output on connector pin 6 
* 'On" and "Off" pilot lights for user notification

## Conclusion 
The water pump subsystem of Team 106’s Automatic Plant Care System efficiently manages the automated watering process. The subsystem utilizes a 9V unregulated wall outlet supply, which is stepped down to a stable 5V through a linear voltage regulator to safely power the Adafruit 5V through-hole water pump. It receives input signals from JT’s moisture sensor (via connector pin 6) to determine soil moisture levels and activate the pump as needed. Additionally, “On” and “Off” pilot lights provide clear visual indicators of the pump’s operational status for the user. Overall, this design ensures reliable, safe, and user-friendly control of plant watering within the automatic system.
