    | Pros                                                              | Cons                |
    | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
    | Favored by hobbyists                                              | Expensive           |
    | 5V rated                                                          | Maintenance needed  |

    | Good water flow                                                   |   

**Choice:** Option 3:  Peristaltic Liquid Pump with Silicone Tubing - 5V to 6V DC Power

**Rationale:** Although this component is pretty expensive compared to its counterparts, it is highly favored by hobbyists and comes from a reliable site with quick delivery times, we are hoping the extra cost can fix some of the grievences about existing products on the market with water pumps with noise and durability being the two most common problems. With this type of water pump the liquid is only touching the tubing instead of the pump internals extending durability and reducing noise.

 3.  IRLML6344 Infineon

    ![](image-6.png)

    - **Price:** $0.49
    - **Product:** [Link to product](https://www.infineon.com/part/IRLML6344)

    | Pros                                                              | Cons                |
    | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
    | Highly favored                                                    | High heat           |
    | Consistent and reliable                                           | Surface Mount
    

**Choice:** Option 2:  IRLZ44N Infineon

**Rationale:** The PIC microcontroller cannot safely power the pump directly so a MOSFET is needed. The MOSFET switches the 5-6V supply on and off rapidly with a PWM signal to control speed and water flow. The IRLZ44N is a good choice here because it can safely handle the pumps motor current without overheating or damaging the microcontroller this meets project constraints by coming in through hole configuration, working directly with 3.3V or 5V microcontroller signals and has a great safety margin for our project outputting virtually no heat.
