    - **Price:** $24.95
    - **Product:** [Link to product](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3910?gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=21079267614&gbraid=0AAAAADx9JvQlcGTZYRF6TWY-XTRT3Qei7&gclid=Cj0KCQjwsPzHBhDCARIsALlWNG2GqUuxTrSHFR22KW7wy2Tp4dqZtKbyARlyKp5T1vI9AJeWGoFzRQcaAiygEALw_wcB)

    | Pros                                                              | Cons                |
    | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
    | Favored by hobbyists                                              | Expensive           |
    | 5V rated                                                          | Maintenance needed  |
    | Meets through hole constraint of project                          |       
    | Good water flow                                                   |   

**Choice:** Option 3:  Peristaltic Liquid Pump with Silicone Tubing - 5V to 6V DC Power

**Rationale:** Although this component is pretty expensive compared to its counterparts, it is highly favored by hobbyists and comes from a reliable site with quick delivery times, we are hoping the extra cost can fix some of the grievences about existing products on the market with water pumps with noise and durability being the two most common problems. With this type of water pump the liquid is only touching the tubing instead of the pump internals extending durability and reducing noise.

    | Pros                                                              | Cons                |

**Choice:** Option 3:  9v 3a

**Rationale:** The 9v 3a is the best choice here because one is already provided in our kit and provides enough power to power both the 6v gear motor and the 12v water pump, although the 12v water pump will not be powered to the full extent. 

**Voltage Regulator**

1. 5V 1.5A Linear Voltage Regulator - 7805

**Choice:** Option 1:  5V 1.5A Linear Voltage Regulator - 7805

**Rationale:** This is a perfect choice, it comes in the kit, the pic is powered by 5v and this will also be able to provide power to the 6v gear motor I am using.
