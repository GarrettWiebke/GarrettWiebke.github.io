**Choice:** Option 3:  Peristaltic Liquid Pump with Silicone Tubing - 5V to 6V DC Power

**Rationale:** Although this component is pretty expensive compared to its counterparts, it is highly vetted by hobbyists and comes from a reliable site with quick delivery times, we are hoping the extra cost can fix some of the grievences about existing products on the market with water pumps with noise and durability being the two most common problems.
