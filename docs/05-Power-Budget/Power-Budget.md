title: Power Budget
---

## Overview
By completing this power budget, the design team confirmed that the subsystem’s 9 V wall supply can safely power all components, with sufficient headroom. This step was essential for validating the system’s electrical reliability, efficiency, and safety, and for ensuring that future revisions or expansions will remain within acceptable power limits.

Capture your power budge as a image to display. Take time to get clean breaks and a well organized layout.

## Conclusions

We have concluded that we can actually power the subsystems components safely with enough power left to add additional components
