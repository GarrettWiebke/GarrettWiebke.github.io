The subsystem utilizes a 9V unregulated wall outlet supply, which is stepped down to a stable 5V through a linear voltage regulator to safely power the Adafruit 5V through-hole water pump. It receives input signals from JT\u2019s moisture sensor (via connector pin 6) to determine soil moisture levels and activate the pump as needed. Additionally, \u201cOn\u201d and \u201cOff\u201d pilot lights provide clear visual indicators of the pump\u2019s operational status for the user. Overall, this design ensures reliable, safe, and user-friendly control of plant watering within the automatic system.</p>","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"02-Component-Selection/Component-Selection/","title":"Component Selection Example","text":"<p>Water Pump</p> <ol> <li> <p>Hiwonder Water pump</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>Price: $7.99</li> <li>Product: Link to product</li> </ul> Pros Cons Better and more reliable water flow Possible durability concerns Easy to use and beginner friendly Meets through hole constraint of project </li> <li> <p>SUBMERSIBLE 3VDC HORIZONTAL PUMP</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>Price: $2.95</li> <li>Product: Link to product</li> </ul> Pros Cons Extremely cheap component More expensive Low voltage rating of 3V Slow shipping speed Meets through hole constraint of project Low water flow Able to be submersed Must be submmersed </li> <li> <p>Peristaltic Liquid Pump with Silicone Tubing - 5V to 6V DC Power</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>Price: $24.95</li> <li>Product: Link to product</li> </ul> Pros Cons Favored by hobbyists Expensive 5V rated Maintenance needed Meets through hole constraint of project Good water flow </li> </ol> <p>Choice: Option 3:  Peristaltic Liquid Pump with Silicone Tubing - 5V to 6V DC Power</p> <p>Rationale: Although this component is pretty expensive compared to its counterparts, it is highly favored by hobbyists and comes from a reliable site with quick delivery times, we are hoping the extra cost can fix some of the grievences about existing products on the market with water pumps with noise and durability being the two most common problems. With this type of water pump the liquid is only touching the tubing instead of the pump internals extending durability and reducing noise.  </p> <p>MOSFET</p> <ol> <li>AO3400A Alpha and Omega Semiconductor </li> </ol> <p></p> <ul> <li>Price: $0.46  </li> <li>Product: AO3400A \u2013 Alpha &amp; Omega Semiconductor Inc.</li> </ul> Pros Cons Very cheap component Possible stall currents Low heat draw Possible durability concerns Is a surface mount Component <ol> <li> <p>IRLZ44N Infineon</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>Price: $1.52</li> <li>Product: Link to product</li> </ul> Pros Cons Overkill for project High heat Consistent and reliable Expensive Meets through hole constraint of project Quick shipping times </li> <li> <p>IRLML6344 Infineon</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>Price: $0.49</li> <li>Product: Link to product</li> </ul> Pros Cons Highly favored High heat Consistent and reliable Surface Mount </li> </ol> <p>Choice: Option 2:  IRLZ44N Infineon</p> <p>Rationale: The PIC microcontroller cannot safely power the pump directly so a MOSFET is needed. The MOSFET switches the 5-6V supply on and off rapidly with a PWM signal to control speed and water flow. The IRLZ44N is a good choice here because it can safely handle the pumps motor current without overheating or damaging the microcontroller this meets project constraints by coming in through hole configuration, working directly with 3.3V or 5V microcontroller signals and has a great safety margin for our project outputting virtually no heat.</p>"},{"location":"03-BOM/BOM/","title":"Bill of Materials","text":"","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"03-BOM/BOM/#overview","title":"Overview","text":"<p>This is the Bill of Materials of the components needed to create the Water Pump Subsystem, this includes refrences that are used in the electrical schematic and an estimated total cost. </p> Part Name/Description Qty Unit Cost Total Cost Manufacturer Manufacturer # Vendor Link Datasheet Link Schematic Reference Designators 5V Peristalic Pump 1 $25.00 $25.00 Adafruit 3910 https://www.adafruit.com/product/3910#technical-details U1 0.1 \u00b5F Ceramic Capacitor, +/-10%, X7R, 50V, 0805 package 5 $0.42 $2.10 Multicomp MCU0805R104KCT C1,C2,C3, (2 extra) 100 Ohm Resistor 5 $0.02 $0.09 Vishay Dale CRCW080510K0JNEB R2, R4, R5 MOSFET, IRLZ44N 55V Single N-Channel Power MOSFET in a TO-220 package 1 $1.52 $1.52 Infineon IRLZ44N Q1 Pushbutton Switch, SPST, 3A, 250V 1 $1.43 $1.43 Multicomp R13-509A-05-BB SW1 1000 Ohm Resistor 2 $0.00 $0.00 Vishay Dale P16-201L R1 100k Ohm Resistor 2 $0.00 $0.00 Vishay Dale 1N4001 R3 <p>Grand Total (estimated): $28.46</p>","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"04-Schematic/schematic/","title":"Schematic","text":""},{"location":"04-Schematic/schematic/#overview","title":"Overview","text":"<p>This is the electrical schematic for the water pump subsystem of team 106's Automatic Plant Care System </p> <p></p>"},{"location":"04-Schematic/schematic/#resouces","title":"Resouces","text":"<p>The schematic as a PDF download is available here</p>"},{"location":"05-Power-Budget/Power-Budget/","title":"Power Budget","text":""},{"location":"05-Power-Budget/Power-Budget/#overview","title":"Overview","text":"<p>By completing this power budget, the design team confirmed that the subsystem\u2019s 9 V wall supply can safely power all components, with sufficient headroom.
