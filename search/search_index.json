With this type of water pump the liquid is only touching the tubing instead of the pump internals extending durability and reducing noise.  </p> <p>MOSFET</p> <ol> <li>AO3400A Alpha and Omega Semiconductor </li> </ol> <p></p> <ul> <li>Price: $0.46  </li> <li>Product: AO3400A \u2013 Alpha &amp; Omega Semiconductor Inc.</li> </ul> Pros Cons Very cheap component Possible stall currents Low heat draw Possible durability concerns Is a surface mount Component <ol> <li> <p>IRLZ44N Infineon</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>Price: $1.52</li> <li>Product: Link to product</li> </ul> Pros Cons Overkill for project High heat Consistent and reliable Expensive Meets through hole constraint of project Quick shipping times </li> <li> <p>IRLML6344 Infineon</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>Price: $0.49</li> <li>Product: Link to product</li> </ul> Pros Cons Highly favored High heat Consistent and reliable Surface Mount </li> </ol> <p>Choice: Option 2:  IRLZ44N Infineon</p> <p>Rationale: The PIC microcontroller cannot safely power the pump directly so a MOSFET is needed. The MOSFET switches the 5-6V supply on and off rapidly with a PWM signal to control speed and water flow. The IRLZ44N is a good choice here because it can safely handle the pumps motor current without overheating or damaging the microcontroller this meets project constraints by coming in through hole configuration, working directly with 3.3V or 5V microcontroller signals and has a great safety margin for our project outputting virtually no heat.</p>"},{"location":"03-BOM/BOM/","title":"Bill of Materials","text":"","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"03-BOM/BOM/#overview","title":"Overview","text":"<p>written context</p>","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"03-BOM/BOM/#bill-of-materials-example-as-table","title":"Bill of Materials Example (as Table)","text":"<p>Table ##: An example of one approach to adding your BOM table to this section.</p> Part Name/Description Qty Unit Cost Total Cost Manufacture Manufacturer # Vendor Link Datasheet Link Schematic Reference Designators 8-bit SIPO/SISO Shift Register, SOIC-16 package 1 $0.49 $ 0.49 NXP 74HC595D,112 DigiKey datasheet link U1 0.1 \u00b5F Ceramic Capacitor, +/-10%, X7R, 50V, 0805 package 10 0.2750 $2.75 KEMET C0805F104K5RACTU PRLTA 109 n/a C2, C4, C6, C7, C8, C9, C10, C11, C12, C16 <p>Note: Setting it up as a table is nice because it is completely viewable without scaling issues.
